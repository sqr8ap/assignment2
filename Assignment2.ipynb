        "1. This paper is about data tidying, or restructuring datasets to allow for easy cleaning.\n",
        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to offer a universal starting point for data exploration and analysis and to simplify the development of compatible analysis tools. Datasets come in many different formats, some of which can be very difficult to work with. The tidy structure allows for an easier and more straightforward cleaning process.\n",
        "3. Sentence 1: Datasets in tidy format all have the same structure and are therefore very similar, but untidy datasets do not share structural characteristics and thus can differ in many more ways. Untidy datasets do not share some structural common denominator in the way that tidy datasets do, and that dissimilarity opens the door to countless potential differences. Sentence 2: When we are working with a dataset, it is generally easy to identify which elements are observations and which elements are variables, especially when we have the context of the data and understand what it is aiming to capture. However, defining a broadly applicable rule or convention for what is a variable and what is an observation is more difficult, as differences in structure present constraints that are not present when looking at one dataset in isolation.\n",
        "4. The term 'value' describes the actual data points in a dataset. Values are generally either strings or numbers. Each value in a dataset maps to both a 'variable' and an 'observation.' Variables contain all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units, whereas observations contain all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "5. In a tidy dataset, the following is true: 1) each variable forms a column, 2) each observation forms a row, and 3) each type of observational unit forms a table. Tidy datasets can be categorized as third normal form.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets are as follows: 1) column headers are values rather than variable names, 2) multiple variables are stored in one column, 3) variables are stored in both rows and columns, 4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and 5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. Table 4 is considered messy because the column headers are values rather than variable names. Melting a dataset involves turning columns into rows and is often referred to as stacking. Melting a dataset eliminates the issue of having column headers that reflect values rather than variable names.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because there are columns for dates, but dates are values. Table 12a is molten because is has been elongated and includes a 'value' column that contains values initially found under the date columns (d1, d2, d3, etc). Table 12b is tidy because each row represents measurements for a single day, and the variables tmax and tmin have been made into columns.\n",
        "8. If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that are compatible with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. Thus, workflow may not always be improved by tidying data. Wickham hopes that future work on the subject of data wrangling will yield better data storage strategies and tools; he hopes that future work will build upon the current tidy framework."

As per the standards set by the OMB, the survey has five minimum categories for race (American Indian or Alaka Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiin or Other Pacific Islander, and White), and in accorcance with legislation passed by Congress, the survey also includes a sixth option (\"Some Other Race\"). The 2020 Census also included new write-in areas so that respondents from all backgrounds could detail their racial identities. In addition to data that comes directly from respondents, the US Census incorporates data from other sources, such as state and local governments as well as commercial entities (Census.gov).\n",
        "2. These data are collected for a number of reasons. Many federal programs rely on access to accurate demographic information for sufficient funding and optimal functioning; for example, the Financial Assistance and Social Services (FASS) program gives financial aid to tribal members who cannot obtain welfare. A program like this needs to have an accurate estimate of how many people they will be serving. Data on race and ethncity is also used in the enforcement of antidiscrimination policies as well as many other federal efforts. These data ultimately play a major role in policy, and thus also play a major role in society and politics. Poor data quality and inaccurate estimates (among other factors, of course) can result in governmental failure to serve the needs of racial groups equitably. Additionally, the Census is used to determine how many seats each state has in the House of Representatives, and the House of Representatives obviously plays an enormous role in American politics and society.\n",
        "3. I think that including additional write-in sections is helpful in theory but may not yield the anticipated results. Respondents may not be motivated to detail their racial backgrounds. I think that it might be a better idea to offer more answer choices than to expect respondents to write in the specifics of their racial backgrounds. I do think that including these write-in areas is objectively a good idea; I just think that there may be better options for capturing diversity more accurately. I think future large scale surveys should present additional answer choices to questions about race and should be available in many forms; allowing respondents to submit their responses digitally was a step in the right direction, in my opinion, and I think that the more ways by which we can submit census data the better. I think that, in general, the Census employs some solid practices in their efforts to obtain accurate and representative data. These practices could definitely be applied more widely, although there are cost concerns. Census data collection is effortful and costly.\n",
        "4. The 2020 Census asked respondents to identify their current sex (male or female) but did not include any questions regarding gender identity or sexual orientation. However, I believe the Census Bureau is now devoting resources to determining how to best ask about/capture gender and sexual orientation, so hopefully the 2030 Census will reflect these new efforts. I think that while asking for the respondent's sex is useful in a lot of ways, it is also rather reductive to not ask about gender identity or sexual orientation. I think these additional categories could provide valuable information that could ultimately help many individuals throughout the country. Gender and sexual orientation are used as grounds for discrimination, and that alone should be reason enough to include them in the Census.\n",
        "5. With protected characteristics, I think missing values may be particularly difficult to explain, as there is a wide range of possible reasons why people may choose not to respond. It can be difficult and even impossible to determine why someone may have left these questions unanswered, and patterns of nonresponse may lead to skewed estimates. To remedy the problems associated with missing values in these areas, people may attempt to impute values, which could be helpful or harmful. People may also make assumptions about why values are missing, which again could be helpful if their assumptions are correct or harmful if their assumptions are incorrect. It can be tempting to make assumptions and/or impute values, but it is important to recognize that these practices are risky and could potentially lead to inaccurate estimates and conclusions.\n",
        "6. I think that an algorithm for imputing values for protected characteristics may run into an issue that is similar to the problem discussed in class with the WWII planes; it may miss an entire subset of responses based on the assumption that these values are missing because they are simply not occurring among the population. This assumption may or may not be true in a given dataset, but it is a risky conclusion to draw regardless. I also think that having limited options to choose for questions about sexuality/gender/race may lead some people to not respond, so missing values may sometimes be a result of people not seeing their identities represented in the answer choice options, and I think an algorithm would have a hard time accurately imputing values for these individuals."
